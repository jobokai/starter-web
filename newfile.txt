Hi boys. I'm Tina. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it. I'm out of control. Dear Diary: Tonight I'm sneaking off to the abandoned taffy factory to look for treasure. Also, if boys had uteruses, they'd be called duderuses. uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I'm out of control. Butts. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. I need to find a boy with a turtle bite on his finger.

I'm gonna write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. Butts. I've logged over 3,000 fantasy hours on my relationship with Jimmy Jr. You don't just throw that away. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life. I'm just not sure if I'll be any good on the grill with one free hand. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in.

If I drunk text you and you're asleep, don't text me in the morningâ€¦that ship has sailed. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. I'm not spooked. What's the next thing after spooked? I'm that. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note? Explore the morgue?
